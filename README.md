# Stripe Invoice Generator

A simple, free invoice generator for Stripe one-time payments built with Next.js. This project was born out of frustration with having to manually create invoices for Stripe payments and not wanting to pay for external services so I pretty much vibe coded this with Claude Code inspired by [@levelsio's Stripe invoice generator](https://gist.github.com/levelsio/b30721cc99166223fcf3dd590d6d0454).

> [!NOTE]
> Stripe now offers post-payment invoice generation for one-time payments, but it's not free. It costs 0.4% of the transaction's total up to a maximum of $2 per invoice.
